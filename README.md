# Mini_Remote

## Desciption

A Mini Remote build around 2 joysticks, on 5-way switch, a NRF24L01 radio and a screen.
To make development easy, it is based on Arduino, but using Platformio because I can't code inside the arduino IDE.

Even if Arduino supports C++, I will try to keep in C as much as possible to be more easily portable.
